# Weekly Review Workflow

A 15-30 minute session to reflect on progress and plan ahead.

## When to Do It

- Friday afternoon (reflect while fresh)
- Sunday evening (prep for the week)
- Monday morning (start week with clarity)

## The Prompts

### Step 1: Review Completed Work

```
What did I accomplish this week?
```

**Example response:**

This week you completed 12 tasks:

**By Goal Alignment:**
- "Ship Q1 roadmap": 4 tasks (roadmap presentation, 2 specs, stakeholder review)
- "Improve activation": 2 tasks (checkout flow analysis, user interviews)
- "Build thought leadership": 1 task (blog post published)
- Maintenance/admin: 5 tasks

**Highlights:**
- Finished Q1 roadmap presentation (P0) - major milestone
- Published your first blog post of the quarter
- Cleared 5 admin tasks that were piling up

**Time invested:** ~18 hours of focused work logged

### Step 2: Check Goal Progress

```
How am I tracking against my quarterly goals?
```

**Example response:**

**Q1 Goals Progress (Week 3 of 12):**

| Goal | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Ship Q1 roadmap | 🟢 On track | Presentation done, specs 60% complete |
| Improve activation by 20% | 🟡 Needs attention | Research done, no implementation started |
| Build thought leadership | 🟢 On track | 1 of 4 planned posts published |

**Recommendations:**
- Activation goal needs more focus next week
- Consider adding a P1 task to kick off checkout improvements

### Step 3: Identify Blockers

```
What's blocked or stalled?
```

**Example response:**

**Blocked tasks (3):**
1. "API integration spec" - waiting on engineering estimates (5 days)
   → Suggest: Follow up with James Monday AM

2. "User research synthesis" - waiting on transcripts (3 days)
   → Suggest: Check with research team

3. "Mobile prototype review" - waiting on design (7 days)
   → Suggest: Escalate to design lead

**Stalled tasks (started but no progress this week):**
1. "Competitive analysis doc" - started 2 weeks ago, 20% complete
   → Is this still a priority?

---

### Step 4: Plan Next Week

```
Help me plan next week. What should my top priorities be?
```

**Example response:**

Based on your goals and current tasks, here's a suggested focus:

**Must do (P0/P1):**
1. Unblock API integration - follow up Monday
2. Start checkout flow implementation planning
3. Write next blog post (due Friday)

**Should do (P2):**
4. Finish competitive analysis
5. Prep for Thursday's product review

**If time allows:**
6. Research AI search feature idea
7. Clean up documentation backlog

**Time budget:**
- Deep work available: ~15 hours
- Meetings: ~10 hours  
- Buffer for urgent items: ~5 hours

Does this feel right, or should we adjust priorities?

## Quick Version (5 minutes)

If you're short on time:

```
Quick weekly review: What did I finish, what's blocked, what's most important next week?
```

## Tips

- Block 30 minutes on your calendar for this
- Do it in a quiet space, not between meetings
- Be honest about what's stalled - it's data, not judgment
- Update GOALS.md if priorities have shifted
