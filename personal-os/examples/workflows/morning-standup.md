# Morning Standup Workflow

A quick 2-minute check-in to set your focus for the day.

## The Prompt

```
What should I work on today?
```

## Example Conversation

**You:** What should I work on today?

**Claude:** Based on your current tasks and goals, here are your top 3 priorities for today:

**1. [P0] Finalize Q1 roadmap presentation** (estimated: 90 min)
- Due tomorrow for leadership review
- Aligns with your quarterly objective: "Ship Q1 roadmap"

**2. [P1] Reply to Sarah's partnership email** (estimated: 20 min)
- Been waiting 3 days, relationship maintenance
- Quick win before deep work

**3. [P1] Write user story for checkout flow** (estimated: 60 min)
- Blocking engineering from starting sprint work
- Supports goal: "Improve activation by 20%"

You have 2 blocked tasks I noticed:
- "API integration spec" - waiting on engineering estimates
- "User research synthesis" - waiting on interview transcripts

Want me to help you get started on any of these?
