Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella de Vil

--- PARODY ---

Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Chill
She traded her fur coat for a Netflix deal
Now she binge-watches puppies on a screen
The most relaxed villain you've ever seen

She swapped her cigarette for herbal tea
Does yoga every morning at a quarter to three
Her spots are now from paint, not dalmatian skin
Cruella de Chill — reformed from within!
